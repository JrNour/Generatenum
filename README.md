Hello 
The first code you will look for is the generatenum.py you will write the amonte of numbers to generate .
for example " 1 to 100000000 " , then it will create a txt file with all the numbers generated .
Then you will look to convert them to hex if you hunting a btc old wallets with the code tohex.py  it will generate a txt file for the input you add.
Then you got hextounadd.py it will convert the hex txt input to uncompressed addresses and give you the output .
Then we have the split.py and the search.py for the split code it will split any txt input at any line for example : my laptop shoutdown or anything and the code for converting
the hex to addresses stopped in the line 40 million and something and the txt file is over 100 million so you will write where you want to split in this case at the line 40 mill .
so you will have new output txt file without the first 40 mill lines , then we have the search.py that code will let you search two txt files even large files so you have to download 
the latest ALL FUNDED BITCOIN ADDRESSES from http://addresses.loyce.club/ and then you can use this txt file as the one to run it against the addresses you got .
Thats all
